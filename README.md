KaVi - Kawi Virtual Keyboard

KaVi - Kawi Virtual Keyboard is an implementation of the Kawi script in Unicode. This keyboard allows users to type in Kawi script for various purposes with an on-screen visual keyboard display. The system was developed by Ilham Nurwansah and was first launched during the International Kawi Festival on August 23, 2023, in Bali.

Currently, the keyboard application is in its early development stages, and some features and functions are not yet fully optimized. We would greatly appreciate any ideas or contributions to improve this application in the future.
